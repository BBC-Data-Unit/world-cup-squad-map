In June 2018 [we published a map](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-44495550) to show the "distinctly northern flavour" of England's World Cup squad: "13 of the 23 players grew up within 50 miles of the centre of Manchester, while two others, Jordan Henderson and Jordan Pickford, hail from Sunderland."

The map was originally created in Carto to provide the ability to drill down to see details on each player. However, in discussion with the Visual Journalism team about the lack of interaction with maps typically seen with users on mobile devices, it was decided to instead create a static map.
